Thank you for passing by! This is FlowingSakura and I had fun making my first web project. 
The purpose of this assignment is to showcase my favorite japanese dishes and my html skills. I implemnted a Minimalist design on my webpage because I was inspired by a Zen Japanese Hotel Website. Please give me some feedback of what you think.

Yours Truly,

FlowingSakura
